B/503, Business Center, MG Road, Pune\n* **Reg.

It seems connected to the Vomilast entry, perhaps a combined tablet, but this needs clarification.\n* The formatting of the original text is quite messy.  This structured version helps clarify the information but confirming all details with the doctor is essential.",
